# my-awesome-copilot

Selfishly opinionated GitHub Copilot prompts, agents, instructions, and skills.

This is not a fork of any canonical "awesome" list. It's a public notebook of the patterns I actually use.
If someone else finds it useful, great.

## Structure

- `copilot/instructions/` — rules of engagement (style, constraints, conventions)
- `copilot/prompts/` — reusable prompt snippets (refactor, review, docs, etc.)
- `copilot/agents/` — role prompts / agent specs (SRE, AppSec, Platform, etc.)
- `copilot/skills/` — repeatable problem-solving playbooks + examples
